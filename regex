## Regex Notes:

Most basic way of pattern matching

***re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)*** returns a list of matched strings

```
e.g.
text = ''' 
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! he's cold: Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff; Life and these lips have long been separated: Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
'''
re.findall('her', text)
['her','her','her']
```

## Special regex characters (Occurence indicators)
., +, *, ?, ^, $, (, ), [, ], {, }, |, \.

```
. -> ANY ONE character except newline. 

+ -> means 1 or more char

* -> means 0 or more

\n -> matches new line

\t -> matches tab

\s -> matches space

\S -> negate of \s (matches everything that does not match \s)

\w -> matches (a-zA-Z0-9_)

\W -> negate of \w (matches every char that is not part of \w)

\b -> TBD ?

\d -> numeric digits (0-9)

\D -> negate of \d, matches [^0-9]
